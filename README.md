side note i made this and didnt even realize coinmarketcap had their own portfolio thing - i am a little dumb


# Portfolio-Calculator

Some java thing I made to calculate my portfolio using coinmarketcap.com

How to use:

Go to App.java, line 20.
You will see something like
  * static {
    .. info ..
   }

Change to how you desire.

info.put("CRYPTOCURRENCY", AMOUNT_OWNED);
 * https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/
 * https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/COPY_THIS_PART_AS_CRYPTOCURRENCY/
